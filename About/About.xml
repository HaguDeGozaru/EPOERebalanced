  <description>Current Version: v0.3\n\nExtensively rebalances items from EPOE:\n* Re-factors most recipes and market values\n* Any part above 'Basic' tier also needs the intellectual skill to be crafted\n* All parts use the part efficiency model as opposed to capacity offsets.\n* Power arms have been heavily nerfed. They're still good, but no longer OP.\n* Glitterworld implants now have offsets based on the equivalent of a certain amount of levels</description>
