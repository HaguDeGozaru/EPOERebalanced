  <description>Current Version: v1.2\n\nExtensively rebalances items from EPOE:\n* Most recipes and market values have been re-factored\n* Any part above 'Basic' tier also needs the intellectual skill to be crafted\n* All appropriate parts use the part efficiency model as opposed to capacity offsets\n* Various parts themselves (e.g. power arms) have been re-balanced too\n* Top-end parts (i.e. power arms, spines, exoskeletons) all need their own researches\n* Workbench building is less material and more component intensive\n* Raiders have higher prosthetic budgets</description>
