  <description>Current Version: v1.0.1\n\nExtensively rebalances items from EPOE:\n* Re-factors most recipes and market values\n* Any part above 'Basic' tier also needs the intellectual skill to be crafted\n* All appropriate parts use the part efficiency model as opposed to capacity offsets.\n* Various parts (e.g. power arms) have been re-balanced too\n* Workbench building is less material and more component intensive</description>
